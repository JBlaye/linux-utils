Notes:
Quickly sets unique config in the Access Control Lists (ACL) for finer 
permission control of specific users & groups.

Will generally require root privileges, use sudo if needed. Or, just login
as root, what could go wrong?


Examples:

Give read & write access to a specific user
	setfacl -m u:bill:rw ~/Documents/diary.md

Give read access to a specific group
	setfacl -m g:spys:r ~/Documents/diary.md

Remove user or group from ACL entry entirely
	setfacl -x u:sam ~/Documents/diary.md

Reset ACL
	setfacl -b ~/Documents/diary/md

Note: Add -R flag to recursively apply to files within a directory
