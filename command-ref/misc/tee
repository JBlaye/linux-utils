Notes:

A command utility to help redirect stdout to a file while still displaying the output
in the terminal. Used in conjuction with the pipe '|' operator.

Examples:

echo 'hello world!' | tee logfile
	This will send the text 'hello world!' to 'logfile' and overwrite

echo 'hello world!' | tee -a logfile
	Adding the '-a' option will append the output to the file rather than
	overwriting the existing the data inside
